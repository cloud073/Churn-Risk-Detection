![Churn Prediction](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*47xx1oXuebvYwZeB0OutuA.png)

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical problems faced by banks and financial institutions. Churn refers to customers leaving the bank, which negatively impacts revenue and customer base.  

The objective of this project is to **predict customer churn** (whether a customer will leave the bank or not) by analyzing demographic and financial information such as **age, credit score, balance, tenure, geography, number of products**, and more.  

By accurately predicting churn, banks can:
- Take **proactive retention actions**.  
- Improve **customer satisfaction & loyalty**.  
- Enhance overall **business profitability**.

## 📊 About the Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Churn for Bank Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers)
- **Size**: 10,000 rows × 14 columns  
- **Task**: Binary Classification (Predict `Exited`: 1 = churned, 0 = retained)

## 🛠️ Workflow & Methodology  

The project follows a **standard machine learning pipeline**:

### 1. 📂 Data Exploration (EDA)
- Distribution of variables  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Churn rate across demographics (age, gender, geography)  
- Balance & product usage trends  

### 2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values (if any)  
- Encoded categorical variables (`Geography`, `Gender`)  
- Scaled numerical variables (`CreditScore`, `Age`, `Balance`, `Salary`)  
- Split into **train & test sets**  

### 3. 💡 Feature Engineering
- Created dummy variables  
- Normalization & standardization where required  
- Explored interaction between features  

### 4. 🤖 Model Building
Tried multiple ML algorithms:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost / LightGBM)**
- (Optional: Neural Networks/ANNs for deep learning approach)  

### 5. 📈 Model Evaluation
- Metrics used: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**  
- Confusion matrix to assess misclassifications  
- ROC Curve visualization  
- Feature importance analysis  

---

## ✅ Results & Key Insights
- **Customer Age** and **Number of Products** are strong predictors of churn.  
- **Geography & Activity Status** significantly impact churn likelihood.  
- Best-performing model achieved:  
  - **Accuracy:** ~85%  
  - **ROC-AUC:** ~0.86  

🔑 Insight: **Older, inactive customers with fewer products and medium credit scores are more likely to churn.**
